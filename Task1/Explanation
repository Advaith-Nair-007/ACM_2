  <div class="question">1. Why did you choose specific imputation methods?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    First, I identified the columns with missing values and handled numerical and categorical features separately.  
    For numerical features, I used the median because it is less affected by extreme values.  
    For categorical features, I used the mode, which is suitable for categorical data.
  </div>

  <div class="question">2. How did you handle outliers and why?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    I used the IQR method to detect outliers by calculating Q1, Q3, and IQR = Q3 − Q1.  
    Values outside the range were capped instead of removed. This reduces the effect of extreme values without losing data.
  </div>

  <div class="question">3. Where and how might data leakage occur in this dataset?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    Data leakage can occur if preprocessing is done before train-test splitting.  
    Examples include scaling before splitting, filling missing values using full data, or using target-related features incorrectly.  
    To avoid this, all preprocessing should be done only on training data.
